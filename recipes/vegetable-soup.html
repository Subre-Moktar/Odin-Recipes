                <p>
                    I like to start off with chopping my Carrots, Celery, and Onions. Then putting them all <br>
                    into a pot to start.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When the ingredients look soft, I would add in the cut Garlic and let the garlic start to cook.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Afterwards I would add in the vegetable broth to the soup and start cutting up my potatoes into small pieces.<br>
                    Adding them after they have all been cut up.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next I would add in all the spices into the vegetable soup. and let it sit until the potatoes become soft.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally I would add in the parsley, corn, and peas into the vegetable soup and let it simmer for a few minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
