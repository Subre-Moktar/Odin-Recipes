        <h1>Salmon with rice</h1>
        <p>
            This is my recipe for how I make my own salmon and rice.
            You would also need an oven since I usually bake my salmon.<br>
            It is a quick recipe taking at most 30 minutes to make.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Start off by cooking the rice. Since I dont own a rice cooker, I usually use the stove top to cook my rice.<br>
                    <strong>Don't Forget to wash your rice!</strong>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Then you would prep the oven to <b>425&deg;F</b> and set you salmon aside. 
                        Next start by putting the spices on the salmon, mix it in 
                        with some oil to help rub it in.<br>
                        Then put the salmon into the oven and let it cook for <b>20</b> minutes.
                    </p>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally take it out and serve it how you like!
                </li>
            </ol>
