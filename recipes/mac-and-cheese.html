                    Start By filling a pot with water and putting chicken bullion in it.<br>
                    Then when its start boiling put in the macaroni. Let it cook and take out when ready.<br>
                    You can also start shredding the cheese if needed.

                    Next you would start to make the roux for the mac and cheese. So use a stick of butter and <br>
                    melt it into the pot. Then mix in the flour with the spices that we added, excepted the chicken bullion.<br>
                    Then add in the heavy cream. Finally after everything is mixed well add in 1lbs of cheese into the roux. <br>
                    You can start up the oven and set it to <b>425&deg;F</b> and let it heat up.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    The final step is mixing the macaroni and the roux in one big pot. Then moving the macaroni into the <br>
                    baking pan. Then add in the last pound of cheese to top off the mac and cheese so it can have that cheesy crust. <br>
                    Personally I would add in a sprinkle of smoked papprika to the top also to add in more flavor. Then set it into <br>
                    the oven for <b>20-25</b> minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

        </ol>
