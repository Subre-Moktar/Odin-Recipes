        <p>
            Hello, this is where I shall be keeping up with recipes that I use personally. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each recipe would start out with the ingredients you need, then would move on to the actual cooking part.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disclaimer: I found most of these recipes online and would be referencing where I found them at the bottom.
            Also I am not very specific about the amount put in, because I usually eyeball the amount I put in.
        </p>
